# React Native Bug: Accessing State/Props Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications where state or props are accessed before they have been fully initialized. This typically occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs because the component renders before the asynchronous data fetching is complete.  Attempts to use the state or props that are still `undefined` or `null` result in errors. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application using a React Native simulator or device.
4. Observe the error message in the console (redbox).
